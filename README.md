## A build order simulator for Age of Empires 2

The web version is running very slowly, so the windows version is recommended

### Web version: https://rillep.github.io/aoe_build_sim/


### Alpha version 1 download link:

- Windows: https://github.com/RilleP/aoe_build_sim/blob/master/aoe_build_simulator_windows_alpha1.zip?raw=true


### There is no tutorial yet of how to use the app, so I'll write some instructions here:
- Each villager created will have a column with all the tasks they are doing, you can press a task to replace it, or press the idle button (Zzz) to add a task after the previous task has been completed.

- If you press the villager icon at the top you will get a list of the selected villagers instructions, where you can rearrange or remove instructions and add new ones. Same thing for the Town center.
- The left column, to the right of the time column, is the event column, where some events are displayed (building built, boar lured, aged up, clicked up). If you click an event, you will get a green row across all villagers. There you can add a task that is linked to when the selected event happens.
- You can also change the order of villagers, by dragging a villager and dropping it inbetween two others. You do this by dragging the icon at the top.
- Click and drag at the time, to the left, to move the time. This way you can see what resources you have at that time ( resources are displayed at the top).
